## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
  * npm (or your favorite package manager)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VRAJESH-31/Ai-powered-Code-Reviewer.git
    cd Ai-powered-Code-Reviewer
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**

      * Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
      * Install the dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
      * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your environment variables. You will need an API key from Google AI Studio.
        ```env
        API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
        PORT=3000
        ```
      * Start the server:
        ```bash
        npm run start
        ```
        The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**

      * Navigate to the frontend directory from the root folder:
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend
        ```
      * Install the dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
      * Start the development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).
